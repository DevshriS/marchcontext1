    <h3>Business Project</h3>
    <p>In the world, a business project are basically collection of tasks. This is simply another way of expressing that
        it is a process or system. However, one of its most distinguishing qualities, in contrast to most business
        systems, is that it has a distinct beginning and conclusion. The majority of business systems are long-term in
        nature. Or, at the very least, have a certain amount of permanence to them. A project, on the other hand, is
        designed as a short-term, one-time undertaking.
