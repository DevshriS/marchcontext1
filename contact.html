    <h1>Project 3 Details</h1>
    <h3>Weather Reporting System</h3>
    <p>This is one of the excellent IoT project ideas for beginners. This IoT-based weather reporting system is
        specifically designed to facilitate the reporting of weather parameters over the Internet. This is one of the
        best IoT projects where the system is embedded with temperature, humidity, and rain sensors that can monitor the
        weather conditions and provide live reports of weather statistics.
