    <h1>Project 2 details</h1>
    <h3>Smart agricultural System</h3>
    <p>One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on IoT projects for students is working on smart
        agriculture system. As the name suggests, this IoT-based project focuses on developing a smart agricultural
        system that can perform and even monitor a host of farming tasks. For instance, you can schedule the system to
        irrigate a piece of land automatically, or you can spray fertilizers/pesticides on the crops wirelessly through
        your smartphone.
